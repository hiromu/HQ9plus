# Installation #
################

To compile hq9plus, type `make'. If everything goes well, you'll have a file
called `hq9plus' in the current directory -- that is hq9plus's binary.

To install it in the system-wide bin directory, make sure you are root, then
type `make install': this will install the man page and the documentation as
well.

The default prefix is /usr, so hq9plus will be placed in /usr/bin: if you want
beef to be installed in another directory, use
`make install prefix=/path/to/dir' -- the man page will be placed in
/usr/share/man/man1 no matter what is the value of prefix. The available
documentation will be installed into /usr/share/doc/hq9plus.

# Usage #
#########

See `man hq9plus' or `hq9plus --help' for more informations on hq9plus's usage. It's
really simple, anyway.
